= Assignment 01

General hints:

* Any programming/scripting language you want is acceptible, under the following
rules:
** You have to add documentation on how to compile/run your program
(at least on a standard, modern Linux x86_64 system, or on Windows (7+))
** The documented way should actually work :)
** Documentation = a new **text** file in the repository.

* If you want to challenge yourself, try a different programming language than the one you're used to. The tasks will be significantly harder and take you a longer time.

== Warmup - FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100 (included).

* Every time the number is divisible by 3, print `Fizz` instead.
* Every time the number is divisible by 5, print `Buzz` instead.
* If the number is divisible by both, print `FizzBuzz`.

== Task - Even Fibonacci numbers

Write a program that sums all the even https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number[Fibonacci number]s less than or equal to `N`.

Details:

* `N` can be a command line parameter or a constant in the source code.
* `N` will always be positive and whole.
* `N` will not be larger than (2\^31)-1.
** Hint: How big could the sum approximately be, if `N` was is large as it can?

== Optional homework

Write a program that when run, prints its source code.

Details:

* The program does not take any input.
* No, an empty program doesn't count :)
* No, reading the file from disk and printing it doesn't count :)
* If you want hints, contact me :)
* Bonus points: Make it as short as possible in the language of your choice.
